Daisy\n            Hildyard suggests that we/you/I have a ‘second body’; the first body\n            consists of your skin, bones, organs, brain etc, whereas the second\n            body can stretch across the world and touch it all simultaneously.\n            Having grown up by and in the ocean, I relate to this idea deeply; I\n            measure my day by the tides rather than a clock. This close\n            relationship is undeniably reflected through my work. Regardless of\n            the medium I am working with, the sea and my relationship with it\n            remains a constant through my work. <br />\n            Through multi-media I am able to explore where/if the boundaries of\n            the human form actually begin and where/if they end. Interacting\n            through film, the artwork becomes an observation of systems,\n            processes and events; a witness. With clay, the interaction is\n            visceral and intuitive; the final artwork becomes the remnants of\n            this close relationship. The work often highlights the push and pull\n            of life; investigating the boundaries that we, as humans, like to\n            perceive as solid, but are actually porous and permeable. The\n            Anthropocene, the period of time we are currently in, where human\n            activity is the main influence on climate and the environment,\n            repeatedly arises in my research. This is not necessarily through\n            focussing on the actual impact that human activity is creating on\n            the world, but my interest lies with the rising awareness that human\n            activity is a part of the world, integrated into the environment,\n            knotted into the ecology of the Earth. These ideas encourage agency\n            in the user. Not just about having the ability to change things,\n            agency is also about acknowledging that things change you. It\n            encourages responsibility; to recognise the other\n            spatio-temporalities that you affect, human and non-human, living or\n            nonliving. <br />\n            <br />\n            ‘Get back to Nature… There is nothing to ‘get back to’, since the\n            problem is not that things are truly distant but that they are in\n            our face – they are our face’ – Timothy Morton\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"column img-column\">\n          <div className=\"image-container\">\n            <img src=\"../../img/artist-statement-image.png\" alt=\"\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </StyledArtistStatement>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
